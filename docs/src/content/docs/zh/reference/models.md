## Token Counting

Understanding token limits helps you optimize your requests:

### Rough Token Estimates

- 1 token ≈ 4 characters (English)
- 1 token ≈ 1-2 characters (Chinese)
- 100 tokens ≈ 75 words (English)
- 100 tokens ≈ 50-100 characters (Chinese)

### Code Tokens

- ~1 token per 4-5 characters of code
- Comments count toward tokens
- Indentation and formatting matter slightly

### Best Practices

1. Be concise in your prompts
2. Remove unnecessary code before analysis
3. Use file chunks for very large files
4. Select models with appropriate context windows

## Rate Limits

### Free Tier

- 100 requests per day
- Resets at midnight UTC
- All models available

### Paid Tiers

| Plan | Requests | Price | Features |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| Basic | 500 | ¥29/month | All models |
| Pro | 2,000 | ¥99/month | Priority support |
| Team | 10,000 | ¥399/month | Team management |

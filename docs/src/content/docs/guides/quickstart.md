## Troubleshooting

### Browser doesn't open

- Check VS Code has permission to open your default browser
- Ensure your default browser is properly configured

### "No pending callback" error

- The callback expires after 5 minutes - try signing in again quickly
- Check your browser security settings aren't blocking redirects

### Can't find Feima models in selector

- Make sure you're signed in: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Feima: Show Account"
- Check the Output panel (View → Output) for any error messages

### Token exchange failed

- Verify feima-idp is accessible: `curl https://idp.feimacode.cn/.well-known/openid-configuration`

# Billing & Pricing

Feima uses a weighted request-based billing model that considers both the AI model you use and the context size of your requests. This fair and transparent system ensures you pay for what you use.

> ⏰ **IMPORTANT: Promotional Credits Expire After 30 Days**
> 
> All credits earned through starter bundles, weekly previews, referrals, bug reports, feature requests, blog posts, and video content **expire 30 days** from receipt. Check your [profile](https://feimacode.com/profile) regularly to see expiration dates and use your credits before they expire!

## Billing Formula

Each request is calculated using a simple formula:

```
weighted_requests = model_multiplier × context_multiplier
```

The result is rounded to 2 decimal places.

### Example Calculations

| Model Tier | Context Size | Model Multiplier | Context Multiplier | Weighted Requests |
|------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Ultra-Lightweight | Small (0-4K tokens) | 0.1x | 0.5x | 0.05 |
| Lightweight | Medium (4K-16K tokens) | 0.5x | 1.0x | 0.50 |
| Standard | Large (16K-32K tokens) | 1.0x | 1.5x | 1.50 |
| Premium | Extra Large (32K+ tokens) | 2.0x | 2.0x | 4.00 |

## Model Multipliers

Different AI models have different costs based on their capabilities and resource requirements:

### Ultra-Lightweight Models (0.1x)

**Examples**: Qwen3 Flash

- **Best For**: Ultra-fast code completion
- **Characteristics**: Extremely fast, minimal resource usage
- **Use When**: You need instant responses for very simple tasks

### Lightweight Models (0.5x)

**Examples**: Qwen3.5 Plus

- **Best For**: Code completion, simple code generation
- **Characteristics**: Fast, efficient, lower resource usage
- **Use When**: You need quick responses for straightforward tasks

### Standard Models (1.0x)

**Examples**: Qwen3 Max, DeepSeek V3.2, Kimi K2.5

- **Best For**: General Q&A, code understanding
- **Characteristics**: Balanced performance and cost
- **Use When**: Everyday coding tasks that don't require advanced reasoning

### Premium Models (2.0x)

**Examples**: Qwen3 Coder Plus, GLM-5

- **Best For**: Large codebase analysis, advanced reasoning
- **Characteristics**: State-of-the-art performance, maximum capabilities
- **Use When**: Critical tasks requiring the highest quality output

## Context Multipliers

Larger context windows require more computational resources:

| Context Size | Token Range | Multiplier |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Small | 0 - 4,000 tokens | 0.5x |
| Medium | 4,001 - 16,000 tokens | 1.0x |
| Large | 16,001 - 32,000 tokens | 1.5x |
| Extra Large | 32,001+ tokens | 2.0x |

### What Are Tokens?

Tokens are the basic units of text that AI models process:

- **English**: Roughly 1 token ≈ 4 characters or ¾ of a word
- **CJK Languages**: Roughly 1 token ≈ 1-2 characters
- **Code**: Tokens vary depending on the programming language and syntax

**Example**: The phrase "Hello, world!" is approximately 4 tokens.

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Lightweight Models for Simple Tasks

```markdown
# Good: Use lightweight model for simple completion
"Complete this function: def calculate_sum(a, b):"

# Avoid: Using premium model for the same task
```

### 2. Keep Context Focused and Concise

```markdown
# Good: Focused context
"Review this function for bugs: [paste 20 lines of code]"

# Avoid: Including entire file when only function is needed
```

### 3. Choose Standard Models for Everyday Coding

Most everyday tasks work well with standard models. Reserve advanced and premium models for:

- Complex algorithm design
- Architecture decisions
- Code review of critical systems
- Large-scale refactoring

## Billing Examples

### Example 1: Code Completion

**Scenario**: Using Qwen Turbo Lite to complete a function

- **Model**: Qwen Turbo Lite (ultra-lightweight, 0.1x)
- **Context**: 2,000 tokens (small, 0.5x)
- **Calculation**: 0.1 × 0.5 = **0.05 weighted requests**

### Example 2: Code Review

**Scenario**: Using Qwen3 Max to review a complex function

- **Model**: Qwen3 Max (standard, 1.0x)
- **Context**: 8,000 tokens (medium, 1.0x)
- **Calculation**: 1.0 × 1.0 = **1.00 weighted requests**

### Example 3: Large Codebase Analysis

**Scenario**: Using Qwen3 Coder Plus to analyze an entire module

- **Model**: Qwen3 Coder Plus (premium, 2.0x)
- **Context**: 50,000 tokens (extra large, 2.0x)
- **Calculation**: 2.0 × 2.0 = **4.00 weighted requests**
